## Global Game Jam ~ 48 hours

### Duck Duck Home
Duck Duck Home is a game about collecting your ducklings scattered around the city and returning them to your home (a pond).

This was a collaboration between me, my friend, and his classmates at SCAD. If you go to the website you'll see a team photo. Unfortunately I live in Canada and the jam was happening somewhere in the states so I wasn't present for photo. But my friend is holding up an image of my discord avatar in his phone so that's good enough!

# Larger Projects

## Space Game

One of my more serious projects. Made over the christmas break in 2017 (I think?).
The main mechanic involves destroying enemies and cannibalizing them for parts.

The following video is a tech overview of the game systems.

## Planetes

A really old game I made in 2017. It involves smashing into asteroids smaller than you to get bigger, allowing you to eat bigger asteroids.

## Asteroids

This is a game I made using C++ and the SFML library. It's a clone of the famous asteroids game. Some of the things I'm most proud of in this are the bounce physics and the procedural asteroid generation.

I used some algorithms (Graham scan) on point clouds to generate random convex polygons for the asteroids.
