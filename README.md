## Technichal Works

### Articulated Deformable Meshes
As part of a graduate course that I balloted into we had to try and solve a novel graphics problem.
The one that me and my team chose was trying to place joints on digital models so that they can be 3D printed and moved around.

This is the resulting paper.
// TODO link to the paper

Certainly not anything SIGGRAPH worthy, but still pretty cool.

### DES
A runtime bytecode language that encodes skill effects.

### Commander AI
A state driven, multithreaded AI engine

### ShipWakeHeightField
A badly named collection of shaders that simulate water in a 2D plane.

## Game Jam Games

### Reading Break Weekend GameJams ~ 48 hours

### Global Game Jam ~ 48 hours

#### Duck Duck Home
Duck Duck Home is a game about collecting your ducklings scattered around the city and returning them to your home (a pond).

This was a collaboration between me, my friend, and his classmates at SCAD. If you go to the website you'll see a team photo. Unfortunately I live in Canada and the jam was happening somewhere in the states so I wasn't present for photo. But my friend is holding up an image of my discord avatar in his phone so that's good enough!

## Larger Projects

### Space Game

One of my more serious projects. Made over the christmas break in 2017 (I think?).
The main mechanic involves destroying enemies and cannibalizing them for parts.

The following video is a tech overview of the game systems.

### Planetes

A really old game I made in 2017. It involves smashing into asteroids smaller than you to get bigger, allowing you to eat bigger asteroids.

### Asteroids

This is a game I made using C++ and the SFML library. It's a clone of the famous asteroids game. Some of the things I'm most proud of in this are the bounce physics and the procedural asteroid generation.

I used some algorithms (Graham scan) on point clouds to generate random convex polygons for the asteroids.
